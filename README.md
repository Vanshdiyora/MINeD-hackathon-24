Team Members : Ronak Chauhan, Naimish Gajjar, Vansh Diyora 



## Overview

ResumeRevealer is Developed for the MINeD 2024 Hackathon, specifically for the "PeopleMetrics: Shaping the Next-Gen Workforce" track supported by Revelio Labs. The project centers on enhancing resume parsing technology, addressing the "ResumeRevealer" challenge. Its goal is to extract comprehensive details from resumes in different formats, categorize text into specific sections, and arrange them chronologically. Additionally, it standardizes job titles using the O-NET database and employs sophisticated skill extraction techniques.
## Problem Statements

Primary Challenge: Develop "ResumeRevealer," a robust resume parser, to accurately extract detailed information from resumes in various formats like PDF, JPG, HTML, DOC, etc. The parser should effectively classify text into separate sections such as education, work experience, and skills, arranging them chronologically based on available dates.

Standardization Challenge: Enhance "ResumeRevealer" to ensure consistency in job titles and occupations by aligning them with the O-NET database, thereby establishing a uniform taxonomy across parsed resumes.

Skill Extraction Challenge: Implement an advanced feature within "ResumeRevealer" to extract detailed skills and competencies from project descriptions and job roles in the resume, emphasizing the candidate's specific abilities and expertise. Abstractive skill extraction would be an additional benefit.
